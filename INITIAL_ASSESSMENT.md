- ✅ **pybind11** for seamless C++/Python integration
- ✅ **pytest** for testing

**Assessment**: Professional-grade tooling. This is the gold standard for hybrid projects.

### 2. **Clean Architecture**
```
inc/          # Headers (interfaces)
src/          # Implementations
tests/        # Test suite

**Assessment**: Professional development workflow.

## 🎯 What I've Added

### 1. **Complete Kinematics Module**

**Files Created:**
- `inc/physics/kinematics/motion.h` - Header with 4 functions
- `src/kinematics.cpp` - C++ implementation (tested ✓)
- Python bindings in `src/main.cpp` - Full integration
- `tests/test_kinematics.py` - 40+ test cases

**Functions Implemented:**
```cpp
position(x0, v0, t, a)           // x = x0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t²
velocity_at_time(v0, t, a)       // v = v0 + a*t
velocity_from_position(...)      // v² = v0² + 2*a*(x-x0)
time_to_position(...)            // Solve for t
```

**Verification**: All functions tested in C++ standalone tests ✓

### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation**

**SETUP_GUIDE.md** (10,000+ characters)
- Complete architecture explanation
- Development workflow
- How to implement physics concepts
- Example problems with solutions
- Tips for learning physics through code

**docs/ADDING_CPP_TESTS.md**
- Guide for adding Google Test
- CMake configuration
- Best practices
- Example test patterns

**Updated README.md**

### 3. **Extensive Test Suite**

**tests/test_kinematics.py** - 40+ tests organized as:
- `TestBasicKinematics` - Fundamental equations
- `TestFreeFallProblems` - Gravity problems
- `TestCarMotionProblems` - Acceleration/braking
- `TestExamProblems` - Complex multi-step problems
- `TestEdgeCases` - Error handling

**Example Test** (from suite):
```python
def test_dropped_object(self):
    """
    Problem: A ball is dropped from 100m.
    How long does it take to hit the ground?
    """
    h0 = 100.0
    v0 = 0.0
    g = -9.8
    
    t = phys.kinematics.time_to_position(h0, 0, v0, g)
    assert abs(t - 4.52) < 0.01  # Expected: 4.52 seconds
```

### 4. **Example Scripts**

**examples/projectile_motion.py**
- Complete projectile motion simulation
- Demonstrates usage of kinematics functions
- Includes visualization code (matplotlib)
- Validates against theoretical predictions

### 5. **C++ Test Infrastructure**

**tests/cpp/test_kinematics.cpp**
- Template for Google Test integration
- Example tests that can be compiled
- Standalone test function (working now)

## 🎓 Why This Setup is Great for Learning Physics

### 1. **Forces Deep Understanding**
Writing physics equations in C++ requires you to:
- Understand the math thoroughly
- Handle edge cases (divide by zero, negative discriminants)
- Think about units and precision
- Debug numerical issues

### 2. **Immediate Validation**
```python
# Write test as you learn
def test_concept():
    """Problem from textbook..."""
    result = phys.kinematics.function(...)
    assert result == expected
```
- Every practice problem becomes a test
- Automated validation of understanding
- Build confidence through passing tests

### 3. **Best of Both Worlds**
- **C++**: Performance, type safety, deep learning
- **Python**: Visualization, experimentation, ease of use

### 4. **Organized Learning**
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Test-Driven Learning
```
For each new concept:
1. Read textbook/lecture
2. Write C++ function
3. Write test (practice problem)
4. Verify solution
5. Move to next concept
```

### 2. Use Python for Exploration
```python
# Quick experiment in Python
import physics_1 as phys
import numpy as np

# Try different initial conditions
for v0 in [10, 20, 30]:
    t = phys.kinematics.time_to_position(0, 100, v0, -9.8)
    print(f"v0={v0}: t={t:.2f}s")
```

### 3. Visualize to Understand
```python
# Plot trajectory
times = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
positions = [phys.kinematics.position(0, 30, t, -9.8) for t in times]
plt.plot(times, positions)
```

### 4. Document Your Learning
Use test docstrings to explain concepts:
```python
def test_concept():
    """
    Newton's Second Law: F = ma
    
    Problem: A 5kg object experiences 20N force.
    What is its acceleration?
    
    Solution: a = F/m = 20/5 = 4 m/s²
    """
```

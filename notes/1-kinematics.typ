= Week 1 - Kinematics

== Goals

- Describe geometric motion of an object in 1D and 2D
- Discuss why an object's motion changes when a force is applied

== Definitions

- Kinematics
  - *How* does an object move?
  - What does the geometry of motion look like?
  - Described using $m arrow(a)$ from Newton's Second Law of Motion
- Dynamics
  - *Why* does an object move?
  - What are the causes of motion?
  - Described using $arrow(F)$ from Newton's Second Law of Motion
- Coordinate Systems
  - Defined with the following properties
    - Origin $(0, 0)$
    - An axis should be logically chosen w.r.t the problem
    - Define unit vector(s) for each point in the coordinate space

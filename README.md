# Physics 1

> A repository dedicated to me learning physics from the ground up.

I have always been interested in physics, but I've only ever taken two classes
in my time at college (physics 1 and 2). Though I did well, I don't feel like I
truly grasped the material; I only learned how to take tests and do homework.

This repository has a few goals

- Work through an undergraduate level physics class at my own pace to fully
understand the material
- Improve my C++ skills outside of work
- Work through and implement the practice problems as test cases to ensure that
my code works
